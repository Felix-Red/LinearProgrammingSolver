# Linear Programming (Operations Research) Solver

This Windows Forms application is designed to solve linear programming problems by allowing users to upload an input text file containing an LP problem and generating an output file with the solution. The application is developed using the IBM CPLEX library, which provides robust optimization capabilities.

In addition to solving the LP problem, the application offers features that allow users to add constraints and perform various analyses, including shadow pricing, duality, and sensitivity analysis. These tools provide valuable insights into the LP problem and help users make informed decisions based on the results.
